Electronics and Computer Engineering(ECM) is a course that aims to integrate two separate engineering fields to meet the joint demands made by the electronics and computer industries in today's world. This programme combines coursework in different aspects of both fields over four years, with an emphasis on the design of computing systems. Electronics and computers, and their joint applications, are playing an ever-increasing role in our lives as Information Communications Technology (ICT), with everything from consumer goods to space shuttles using electronic hardware (circuits) and computer software integrated together. The increased use of ICT in every aspect of our lives ensures the continued relevance of this a Department of ECM has the expert faculty from both electronics background and Computer Science background. Students can avail the expert knowledge in electronics as well as Computer Science.            {/* Add the full description from the image here */}

            It is a great opportunity of being Head of the department of ECM branch. I feel proud to introduce about the department's strength and achievements. The department of ECM is offering UG course with an intake of 120 in B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and post-graduation program with an intake of 18 in M.Tech Transportation Engineering. The students of civil are good in both academics as well as in extra and co-curricular activities. Our students are provided a solid engineering education, with a focus on creativity and innovation, and a strong ethical responsibility. The civil engineering program prepares graduates with strong leadership qualities. These leadership qualities and our program's high technical standards generate strong interest from industries and employers across the region.
