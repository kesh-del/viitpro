A warm welcome to CSE@Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology……..

CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) at the Vignan’s Institute of Information Technology has its seeds in the erstwhile Institute set up in 2002. While at inception, it was primarily focused on academics, the ambit expanded on the journey to include M.Tech Programmes, Research and Placements, Research Center, and NBA Accreditations (2009 and 2017), leading to the current name.

CSE Department focuses on academics, creative research, and good placements in three broad areas of computer science:
<br></br>
• Computer Science and Engineering, including basic concepts, number theory, complexity theory, graph theory, coding theory, algorithms, data structures, cryptography and security.
<br></br>
• Computer Systems and Software, including computer architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, software engineering, database systems, graphics and visualization, communication networks, and distributed computing.
<br></br>
• Intelligent Systems, including data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization, information retrieval, and scientific applications.            {/* Add the HoD's message here */}
