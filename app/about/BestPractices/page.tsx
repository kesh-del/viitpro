              VIIT has introduced a distinct initiative to honour and appreciate parents for their invaluable support.
              Their contributions have not only stimulated programme success but also propelled the other students to
              be more active and serious about their careers. A carefully crafted curriculum with supplementary courses
              and structured training from the first semester onwards contributed to student success. In addition,
              parent involvement in the Mentor-Mentee program significantly supported the achievements of students.

              The main objective of this initiative is to extend the intellectual horizons of faculty members, improve
              their teaching skills and research capabilities, and thereby foster career enhancement. To train faculty
              with diverse teaching methods, ICT tools, e-content creation, and to engage in Inter-Disciplinary and
              Trans-Disciplinary research aligned with NEP 2020 and sustainable goals. Orientation programs for new
              faculty members emphasize institute vision and mission, work culture, effective teaching, and qualities
              such as empathy, emotional balance, transparency in evaluation, and the significance of research for career
              advancement.
