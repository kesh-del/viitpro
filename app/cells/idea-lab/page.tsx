        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The IDEA Lab is a one of its kind labs which gives a wide exposure to the young talents in and around the Institute to experiment their ideologies.<br/>
          We have 7 Research Laboratories and 48 Academic Laboratories, from which 1000s of mini to major projects have been executed so far. The expertise gained from these existing facilities will be utilized for the IDEA Labs in idealization, Planning, Designing, Programming, Prototyping, Implementing and Promotion.<br/>
          The products developed from the IDEA Lab will be used as primary or feeder units at our existing facilities.<br/>
          The expertise gained from our wide number of projects executed in our existing facilities will be utilized in IDEA Labs, to minimize the failures.<br/>
          The experimental statistics of the research papers being communicated and published by our highly qualified researchers will be through IDEA Labs.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#0077B5] mb-2 mt-8">Alignment with National Initiatives & SDGs</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          We will align with National Initiatives such as Make in India, Swatch Bharat and Vision 2035. We look forward to utilize all equipment and machinery made in India, with a motto to achieve the initiative of Aatma Nirbhar Bharat. The only moto of the lab is to transform the lab into an organization and provide an opportunity to the students and society by large, to enhance his/her innovative capabilities and bring out entrepreneurs and thus encouraging Make in India. We will focus more on MANUFACTURING in the areas of a combination of software with other disciplines.<br/>
          Aligning with the SDGs, we will build and sustain resilient Infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation with students, faculty, and students of close by colleges. We will also collaborate with the close by institutes and share the knowledge amongst all colleges, developing the society by large, addressing challenges in electricity, sanitation, and agriculture.<br/>
          We will integrate with schools who have Atal Tinkering Labs and help them grow to the next level, with the facilities in the IDEA Lab. The lab in its 24 hours of operation, will be available for any immediate needs of the society. The Lab will be tuned to work not only for any revenues, but also to manufacture products that develops the region in eradicating pains of primary education, sanitation and agriculture.<br/>
          We will work with an objective of no-pollution, and develop standard operating procedures to make it a practice than a rule defined in the lab. The nation initiatives will be discussed as soon as it is published by the central government, and action plan will be drafted within a week, to align the initiatives in sync with the new discussions. Technology advancements in health industry will also be focused in collaboration with hospitals.
