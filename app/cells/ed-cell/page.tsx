          The Entrepreneurship Development Cell was established at the institution to promote the concept of entrepreneurship among students.<br/>
          The Cell's goal is to create an entrepreneurial environment on campus as well as to provide a venue for students to turn a concept into a fundable technological start-up.<br/>
          The cell also aims to equip academics who are interested in and enthusiastic about programme implementation. Since its beginnings, the cell has encouraged students to consider options other than placements or jobs.<br/>
          There are a lot of motivational speeches and events to help kids learn how to be more entrepreneurial.
